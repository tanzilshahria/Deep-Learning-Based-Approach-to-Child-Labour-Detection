# Deep-Learning-Based-Approach-to-Child-Labour-Detection

Considering the unavailability of an open sourced child labourers dataset in the context of the mentioned region, a noble dataset of such kind has been formulated in this project. A child labour recognizing model has been built based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the dataset.
